# Welcome to Blokaly 

## Introduction

[Blokaly](https://www.blokaly.com) is a badge issuance and display platform, built based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).

The idea is borrowed from [OpenBadges](https://openbadges.org/) and [BLOCKCERTS](http://www.blockcerts.org/), where any users can create, issue and display badges.
The badges are digitally signed using cryptography by the issuers and persisted onto IPFS, which is characterized as immutable, permanent and distributed network storage.
So the badge can be treated as a tamper-proof digital certificate and could be publicly verified and shared across the web.

## Publish

To issue or publish badges, click the [New](https://www.blokaly.com/publish/new) sidebar menu under Publish, 
then follow the steps to fill in the badge image IPFS hash code, badge name and description.
If you don't have the IPFS image hash codes, there are three pre-uploaded ones you can use:

- [Blokaly Golden Cup](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTof1PEHHnHtBjgyG8SNAjJpqUX32N3fKSdtx9tTntLy) `QmcTof1PEHHnHtBjgyG8SNAjJpqUX32N3fKSdtx9tTntLy`
- [Blokaly Silver Cup](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeTpJx1cvc2RVN5dNtZ44KStWuFz8V6aQeU9MvRasMLJ1) `QmeTpJx1cvc2RVN5dNtZ44KStWuFz8V6aQeU9MvRasMLJ1`
- [Blokaly Bronze Cup](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNqyypD8PgroZAtk4FhgyWgY8X7NWLPwHF3BVpTwj8vG) `QmXNqyypD8PgroZAtk4FhgyWgY8X7NWLPwHF3BVpTwj8vG`

If you have your own image for the badge, you can download Blokaly's [BIX](https://github.com/blokaly/bix) tool to upload it onto IPFS first.

Then select with type of badges you would like to issue, either an Individual or a Group one. You need to fill in the recipient email for the Individual badge.

After the publish process completed, click the **Share** button to preview the issued badge and copy the URL, which should be something like `https://www.blokaly.com/bao/Qmxxxxxx`.
The long string starts with _Qm_ is the [BAO](/en/tech/#bao) IPFS hash code. Share this link with your recipient if an individual badge or send to a group of people so they can apply for this badge.
 
You can find all the issued badges by clicking the [History](https://www.blokaly.com/publish/history) sidebar menu.
For a group type of badge, you can see all the applicants of it and take actions `accept`, `reject` or `issue` on each of them.   


## Apply or Claim

Once the badge issued onto IPFS, then you can share the badge's [BAO](/en/tech/#bao) hash code or URL with the intended receiver(s).
The receiver would be able to **Claim** (if individual type) or **Apply** (if group type) for the badge by clicking the corresponding button.
